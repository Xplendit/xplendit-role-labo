# Ansible role `labo`

My first (incomplete) role for the assignments for the course Enterprise Linux.
It changes the certificate and puts the interface in a public zone.


You need to create and place your certificates in the templates folder.
Make sure you name your certifcates localhost. You can use the following website to create your certificate: [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self)

Make sure you use the right extension in the command!
